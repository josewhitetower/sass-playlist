### Day 1: August 28, 2017    

**Today's Progress**:   
1. Today I learnt about mixins and how to import files.  
2. There is an option in Prepros, that allows to autompile or not the .saas files. You must have only one file to compile, the rest should be imported in the last one.  
3. Pseudo Classes and How to import a mixin (that's included in a mixin.scss file) -> @include [name_of_the_mixin]

### Day 0: August 27, 2017  
Introduction to SAAS  
**Today's Progress**:   
1. I installed SASS on my computer using [Prepros](https://prepros.io/downloads) A tool to compile sass files to css and visualize live reload changes  
2. I learned how to declare SASS variables and nest them.  

**Thoughts**:    
1. It was a lit bit complicated to see it like in the video. I just noticed that there are some differences between the files in the video and the git repostiory. I had to add a link to the reset.css file.
