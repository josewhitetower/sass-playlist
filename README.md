### Day 3: August 30, 2017    

**Today's Progress**:   
1. Today I learnt how to create a grid using math operators and mixins.  
2. Colour functions  
3. The @Content Keyword  
4. If Statements

**Thoughts**:     
1. There's a math form, the operators need to be separated by space.  
2. Remeber, you can pass parameters to the mixins.  
3. [Here](http://sass-lang.com/documentation/Sass/Script/Functions.html) you can find the Functions reference  
4. The @content keyword allows to a mixin that you can use everywhere, with params you can define it as you like and it will take that to the mixin that contains the @content keyword  
5. If you dont know how many params a function will have you can use ($arg...) as parameters, it will generate a list, and you can find the length of this list unsing the function length().

### Day 1: August 28, 2017    

**Today's Progress**:   
1. Today I learnt about mixins and how to import files.  
2. There is an option in Prepros, that allows to autompile or not the .saas files. You must have only one file to compile, the rest should be imported in the last one.  
3. Pseudo Classes and How to import a mixin (that's included in a mixin.scss file) -> @include [name_of_the_mixin]  

**Thoughts**:     
1. Surprisely the style worked fine, not like the night before.

### Day 0: August 27, 2017  
Introduction to SAAS  
**Today's Progress**:   
1. I installed SASS on my computer using [Prepros](https://prepros.io/downloads) A tool to compile sass files to css and visualize live reload changes  
2. I learned how to declare SASS variables and nest them.  

**Thoughts**:    
1. It was a lit bit complicated to see it like in the video. I just noticed that there are some differences between the files in the video and the git repostiory. I had to add a link to the reset.css file.
